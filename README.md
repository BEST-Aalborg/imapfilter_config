This is the config file that BEST Aalborg used to sort emails from @BEST.eu.org.

The necessity for this comes from the fact that a good handful of besties don't use the right tags when sending emails. This is especially true for the mails send to the LBGs@BEST.eu.org mailing list, even through the rules about the different tags are written on the same pages.
